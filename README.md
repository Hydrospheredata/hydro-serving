Hydro Serving is a Machine Learning Serving cluster. 

Features:
* **Serverless** user experience in your data center or public cloud. 
* State of the art architecture based on **Service mesh** powered by Envoy proxy  
* **Plumbing**. Automatic generation of Protobuf contracts for REST, gRPC and Streaming Kafka API from the model metadata
* Safe experiments and models warm up on **shadowed or canary traffic**
* Unified across ML frameworks
* Automatic data profiling and statistical check of the model quality 
* Immutable model versioning
* Agnostic to training pipeline and notebook environment 
* **Multi-framework Pipelines** (e.g. Scikit-learn -> Spark ML -> TensorFlow pipeline)
* Out of the box tuned and optimized Serving Runtimes
* Models optimization for Serving

## Quick Start

#### Run
```bash
#Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving

# Full environment with kafka and Sonar
cd ./hydro-serving/integrations
docker-compose up

#Or lightweight environment
cd ./hydro-serving
docker-compose up
```

Go to UI: http://localhost/

#### Deploy your first model

```bash
#Install Serving CLI
pip install hs

# Clone repo with example models
git clone https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving-examples
cd hydro-serving-examples/stateful_lstm_example/pipeline/lstm
# Upload model to the server
hs upload
```

#### Check UI - explore, deploy and test models
