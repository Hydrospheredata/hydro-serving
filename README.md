Hydrosphere Serving is a cluster for deploying and versioning  your machine learning models in production.

- **Framework Agnostic**. Serve machine learning models developed in any language or framework. Hydrosphere Serving will wrap them in a Docker image and deploy on your production cluster, exposing HTTP, GRPC and Kafka interfaces.
- **Traffic split**. Split your production traffic between your models to perform an A\B test or canary deployment. 
- **Traffic shadowing**. Shadow your traffic between different model versions to examine how different model versions behave on the same traffic.
- **Model Version Control**. Version control your models and pipelines as they are deployed. Explore how metrics change, roll-back to a previous version and more.


## Getting Started

You can refer to our [documentation](https://hydrosphere.io/serving-docs/latest/index.html) to see tutorials, check out [example projects]([https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving-example](https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving-example)), and learn about all features of Hydrosphere.

## Installation

There are two main ways of installing Hydropshere:
* [Docker](https://hydrosphere.io/serving-docs/latest/install/docker.html);
* [Kubernetes](https://hydrosphere.io/serving-docs/latest/install/kubernetes.html).


### Docker
Before installing Hydrosphere Serving, please install its prerequisites: 
* [Docker 18.0+](https://docs.docker.com/install/);
* [Docker Compose 1.23+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

To install Hydrosphere Serving, follow the instructions below:

1. Download the latest release version from the [releases](https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving/releases) page;
    ```sh 
    export HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE=2.1.0
    wget -O hydro-serving-${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}.tar.gz https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving/archive/${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}.tar.gz
    ```
1. Unpack the tar ball;
    ```sh 
    tar -xvf hydro-serving-${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}.tar.gz
    ```
1. Set up an environment.
    ```sh
    cd hydro-serving-${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}
    docker-compose up
    ```

To check installation, open http://localhost/. By default Hydrosphere UI is available at port 80.

**Note**, other installation options are described in the [documentation](https://hydrosphere.io/serving-docs/latest/index.html).

### Kubernetes
Before installing Hydrosphere Serving, please install its prerequisites: 
* [Helm 2 starting from 2.9+](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#install-helm) with the tiller installed on the cluster;
* [Kubernetes 1.8 and above](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) with beta APIs enabled.

```shell
export HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE=2.1.0
helm install --name serving --namespace hydrosphere https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving/releases/download/${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}/helm.serving-${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}.tgz
```

To reach the cluster, port-forward `ui` service locally. 

```
kubectl port-forward -n hydrosphere svc/hydro-serving-ui-serving 8080:9090
```

To check installation, open http://localhost:8080/.

**Note**, other installation options are described in the [documentation](https://hydrosphere.io/serving-docs/latest/index.html).
