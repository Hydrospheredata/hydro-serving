## What is ML Lambda? 

__ML Lambda__ is an open source model management cluster for deploying, serving and monitoring machine learning models and ad-hoc algorithms. It enables you to get your models up and running in an instant, on just about any infrastructure and using any of the available machine learning toolkits. It lets you monitor your models' performance, analyse their inputs (for example, determine whether there is recently an increased number of outliers or not), observe models' inference on given data and so on.
