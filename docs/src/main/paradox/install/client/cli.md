## Usage

- `$ hs cluster`

    This command lets you operate with cluster instances. A cluster points to your Hydrosphere instance. You can use this command to work with different Hydrosphere instances.  

    See `hs cluster --help` for more information.

- `$ hs upload`

    This command lets you upload models to the Hydrosphere platform. During the upload, `hs` looks for a `serving.yaml` file in the current directory. This file **must** contain a definition of the model (@ref[example](../../how-to/write-definitions.md#kind-model)). 
    
    See `hs upload --help` for more information.

- `$ hs apply` 

    This command is an extended version of the `hs upload` command, which allows you to also operate on applications and host selector resources.
