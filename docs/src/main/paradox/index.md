__Hydrosphere Serving__ is an open source model management cluster for 
deploying, serving and monitoring machine learning models and ad-hoc 
algorithms. 

It enables you to get your models up and running in an instant on just 
about any infrastructure and using any of the available machine learning 
toolkits. 

It lets you monitor your models performance, analyse their inputs, observe
