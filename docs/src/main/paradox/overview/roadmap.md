    - Hyperparameter candidates based on historical data & model
    - HBOS with grid search 
    - Add LOOP and IsolationForest algorithms
    - Add algorithm suggestion based on historical data 
    - Add more algorithms [TBD]
- High-Dimensional Visualization
    - Make UMAP visualization with predefined parameters on data
    - Add anomaly-wise and class-wise coloring of visualized data
    - UMAP Grid Search for optimal hyperparameters
    - Add continuous anomaly-wise and class-wise colorings
    - Add counterfactuals and closest neighbours
    - Add ability to isolate subset of points
    - Add image support
