# What is Hydrosphere?

Hydrosphere is an open-source platform for managing machine learning models. It aims to:

1. Simplify the process of delivering machine learning models to production;
1. Decrease the uncertainty of what is going on, when your model is serving a production load;
1. Gain insights on how your model can be improved according to your production data.

It provides you with the functionality of deploying machine learning models into production, configuring different inference architectures, monitoring your models from data perspective and analysing, and understanding why a particular prediction was made by your model.
