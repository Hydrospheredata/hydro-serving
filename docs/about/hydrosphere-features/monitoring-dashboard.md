# Monitoring Dashboard

Monitoring Dashboard lets you track your performance [metrics](../concepts.md#metrics) and get a high-level view of your data health.

Monitoring Dashboard plots all requests streaming through a model version which are colored in respect with how "healthy" they are. On the horizontal axis we group our data by batches and on the vertical axis we group data by signature fields. In this plot cells are determined by their batch and field. Cells are colored from green to red, depending on the average request health inside the batch.
