Gateway is a service responsible for routing requests to/from or between Servables and Applications and validating these requests for matching a Model's/Application signature.

The Gateway maps a modelâ€™s name to a corresponding container. Whenever it receives a request via HTTP API, GRPC, or Kafka Streams, it communicates with that container via the gRPC protocol.
