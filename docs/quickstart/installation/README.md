# Installation

The Hydrosphere platform can be installed in the following orchestrator's:

1. [Docker Compose](./#docker-installation)
2. [Kubernetes](./#kubernetes-installation)

## Docker installation

To install Hydrosphere using `docker-compose`, you should have the following prerequisites installed on your machine.

* [Docker 18.0+](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Docker Compose 1.23+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

### Install from releases

1. Download the latest $released\_version$ release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving/releases):

```bash
export HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE=released_version
wget -O hydro-serving-${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}.tar.gz https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving/archive/${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}.tar.gz
```

1. Unpack the tar ball:

```bash
tar -xvf hydro-serving-${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}.tar.gz
```

1. Set up an environment:

```bash
cd hydro-serving-${HYDROSPHERE_RELEASE}
docker-compose up
```

### Install from source

1. Clone the serving repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving
   ```

2. Set up an environment:

   ```bash
   cd hydro-serving
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

To check the installation, open [http://localhost/](http://localhost/). By default, Hydrosphere UI is available at port **80**.

## Kubernetes installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
By default, Hydrosphere spins up a minimal installation applicable only for **testing** purposes. Consult [this](configuring-helm-charts.md) document for details about deploying **production-ready** Hydrosphere instance.
{% endhint %}

To install Hydrosphere on the Kubernetes cluster you should have the following prerequisites fulfilled.

* [Helm 3.0+](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#install-helm)
* [Kubernetes 1.16+ with v1 API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
* PV support on the underlying infrastructure \(if persistence is required\)
* Docker registry with pull/push access \(if the built-in one is not used\)

### Install from charts repository

1. Add the Hydrosphere charts repository:

   ```bash
   helm repo add hydrosphere https://hydrospheredata.github.io/hydro-serving/helm
   ```

2. Install the chart from repo to the cluster:

   ```bash
   helm install --name serving --namespace hydrosphere hydrosphere/serving
   ```

### Install from source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-serving.git
   cd hydro-serving/helm
   ```

2. Build dependencies:

   ```bash
   helm dependency build serving
   ```

3. Install the chart:

   ```bash
   helm install --namespace hydrosphere serving
   ```

After the chart has been installed, you have to expose the `ui` component outside of the cluster. For the sake of simplicity, we will just port-forward it locally.

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n hydrosphere svc/serving-ui 8080:9090
```

To check the installation, open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
